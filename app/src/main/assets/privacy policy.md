#### **1. We Collect NO Personal Data From You**  
- **Your project runs 100% locally.** We **do not collect, store, or access** any personal information from you (e.g., names, emails, files, device data, or usage habits).  
- **We never save your data.** All processing happens on your device. Nothing is sent to us or third parties *unless you choose to watch an ad* (see Section 2).  

#### **2. Voluntary Ads: Only If You Press the "Watch Ad" Button**  
- **Ads are 100% user-initiated.** If you press the "Watch Ad" button:  
  - Google’s ad service AdMob **loads and displays an ad**.  
  - **At this point only**, Google *may* collect limited data (e.g., device ID, IP address, ad interaction) to serve the ad.  
  - **If you never press the button, Google collects NOTHING from you through our app.**  
- **Why we disclose this:**  
  Google requires this disclosure under its Ad Policies. We have **no control** over Google’s data practices.  
- **Your choices:**  
  - Skip the ad → **No data collected by Google** via our app.  
  - Watch the ad → Google’s practices apply (see Google’s Privacy Policy).  

#### **3. What About Cookies?**  
- **No cookies are set by our app.**  
- **Google may use cookies** *only* when you watch an ad (to serve relevant ads). This happens **exclusively through Google’s systems**, not ours.  

#### **4. Compliance with Privacy Laws**  
- **GDPR (EU)/CCPA (California):**  
  - Since we collect **zero data** from non-ad viewers, these laws don’t apply to us *for your core usage*.  
  - **If you watch an ad in the EU**, Google treats your button press as consent to process data for ads (per Google’s EU requirements).  
- **We do NOT sell your data.** Ever.  

#### **5. Changes to This Policy**  
- We’ll notify you via GitHub if ads are added/changed (unlikely, as we intend to keep this simple).  

#### **6. Contact**
